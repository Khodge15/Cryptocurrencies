## Cryptocurrencies

### Overview

The purpose of this project is create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output unsupervised learning will be used. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm will be used along with data visualization of the results.
